## Background and Description

Have you ever walked aroud your hometown, or any town in the United States, seen a old property and thought to yourself, "I wonder what used to be here?" History Maps is here to answer that question! By simply inputting your current address or any address in the U.S., History Maps provides a list of historical buildings and photos related to that address. 

Using Mapquest API, History Maps connects to the Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey based up the searched location. The results are based upon the county result from the initial search.
